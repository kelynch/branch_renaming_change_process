The Renaming Branch Working Group is in the process of renaming the default branch from `master` to `main` in Samvera and Samvera-Labs repos.  This brings repositories into compliance with the Samvera Community Code of Conduct (https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405212316/Code+of+Conduct)  and language recommendations (https://github.com/samvera/maintenance/blob/master/templates/CONTRIBUTING.md#language).

This issue will be complete when the `master` has been renamed to `main`.

Related issues will have a title beginning with `RENAME`.
