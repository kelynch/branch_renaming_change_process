Add the following branch renaming language to the README for this repository.

```
## Contributing 

If you're working on PR for this project, create a feature branch off of `main`. 

This repository follows the [Samvera Community Code of Conduct](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405212316/Code+of+Conduct) and [language recommendations](https://github.com/samvera/maintenance/blob/master/templates/CONTRIBUTING.md#language).  Please ***do not*** create a branch called `master` for this repository or as part of your pull request; the branch will either need to be removed or renamed before it can be considered for inclusion in the code base and history of this repository.
```

### Rationale

Git's default "master" branch derives from "master/slave" jargon which perpetuates systemic racist language and systems (see email [Replacing "master" reference in git branch names](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html)). To uphold our Code of Conduct, we must move away from the term "master" in our technical language (as well as words like blacklist or whitelist).
